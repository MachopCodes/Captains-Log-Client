Captains Log is an application that helps people plan their boating trips.

To use the application's features, a user has to create an account, and then create a "trip" which includes submitting a launch date, and city/state pair.

The user can view their trips from the link on the nav bar and select a specific trip from that index to view, update, delete or get tidal information via a get tides button.

The application takes the city state pair and matches it up with a coordinate index to retrieve the coordinates for that city.

The coordinate pair and launch date are then sent to the tides rapidapi https://tides.p.rapidapi.com/tides which returns tide data for that coordinate pair.
